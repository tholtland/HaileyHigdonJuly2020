      <p>“In Higdon’s hands, everything connects to everything else, and the
          interplay here is magical, existing as a series and sequence of
          lights revealing the multiple threads throughout the whole.”

              <p>“The poems in <i>Hard Some</i> mysteriously invite us to reflect on
          something almost spiritual: the ways that relationships change us.
          It is in our capacity to love that our transformation lies. To hurt
          the people we love, and to make amends; to understand our capability
          to hurt the people we love, and to resist hurting them. This is how
          we are changed; this is how we change.”

          <p>In a time when all meanings seem to have already been uttered and all forms have already been experimented with, up to the point of rewriting existing writings, Hailey Higdon manages to still be an original. Her writing is weird and sophisticated but without giving an inch in the task of feeling deeply. Her artifice is to die for.</p> 
          <h6>-Maged Zaher</h6>
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        <p>In <i>Hard Some</i>, each poem takes a relatively simple phrase—such as 'two women walk into a town'—and then turns it into something that is story and meditation. These are poems that look simple at first glance; they are quiet and spare. But they build into something large, relational, full of other people, theories of connection and queerness.</p> 
          <h6>-Juliana Spahr</h6>
        <p>&nbsp</p>
        <p><i>Hard Some</i> leads the reader into the depths of a queer dailiness. These several sequences breathe through layers of perception (quartz) and offer a kind of strumming sensation to the language. Higdon is not tracing the landscape underfoot but sketching the actual atmosphere it creates, both in and outside of our bodies. I feel endless, pleasing reverberations in this work akin to the poetry of Joanne Kyger, Bob Grenier, and Lisa Robertson. “btw how you treat you/ is reciprocal/ because you are more than one.” This is an essential book for our increasingly dark age.</p>
